# Overview:

This directory contains global annual mean surface concentrations and radiative forcing of PM2.5 and ozone in 2014 and 2030 processed from GEOS-Chem output simulations with and without charcoal emission in 2014 and 2030. Also included in the directory are activity data for charcoal production and use in 2014 and 2030.
